# Game Manager
A Game Manager website written in PHP using MVC architecture. 

## Purpose
I started to build this website as a personal project to pratice my abilities in PHP, using the MVC architecture as we saw in class.
In addition to PHP, I also use it to practice my HTML and CSS fundamentals. It also made me use Bootstrap for the first time.
I plan to add some JavaScript (and jQuery) after finishing implemanting the fundamentals of the website.

## Functionalities
- Manage 
-

## Technical overview
- Built from scratch using the Model-View-Controller architecture, using Object-Oriented PHP.
- Design made using Bootstrap 4.
- Entirely W3C valid.
- All SQL queries are written using PDO and are merged in an unique class (see /models/Db.class.php).
- Every entity from the SQL database can and is represented by a dedicated object (kind of Object-Relational Mapping). 
- There is no JavaScript used at the moment since we haven't seen it in class, but I'm working on it on my free time.
